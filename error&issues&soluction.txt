WHILE STARTING NPM WITH "eslint-config-ract-app, base.js" still in "package.json".

    [eslint] Plugin "react" was conflicted between "package.json » eslint-config-react-app »

CORS(Cross-Origin-Resource Sharing)
(encountered at section 2.2.1 & 2.2.2(frontend documentation))

Error:

    21:52:03.543 Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading 
    the remote resource at https://localhost4040/api/workouts. 
    (Reason: CORS request did not succeed). Status code: (null).

    This happens while using the different server to perform a resource sharing among them.
    for production solution, we need to specify the correct API endpoint.

Solution:

    we added the "proxy" which value is the reffered server inside "package.json" which inside our frontend folder.
    there is another alternative or install the package called CORS and use that insdie 
    the backend server to allow this "Cross Origin Request".


"Uncaught TypeError : workouts.map is not a function"

Error : 

    00:21:07.907 Uncaught TypeError: workouts.map is not a function
        Home Home.js:23

Explanation :

    It attempted to call a value from a function, but the value is not actually a function. 
    Some code expects you to provide a function, but that didn't happen. 

Solution :

    put the await promise function inside "resData" constant.
